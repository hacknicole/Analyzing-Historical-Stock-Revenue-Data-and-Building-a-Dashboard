# Hands-on Lab: Analyzing Historical Stock/Revenue Data and Building a Dashboard
<p align="justify"> As a data scientist working for an investment firm, you will extract the revenue data for Tesla and GameStop and build a dashboard to compare the price of the stock vs the revenue.</p>

# Project Overview
<p align="justify">For this project, you will assume the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst working for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks. Your job is to extract financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and web scraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data you will visualize it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks we will work with our Tesla, Amazon, AMD, and GameStop.</p>

## Dashboard Analytics Displayed
<p align="justify">A dashboard often provides a clear view of key performance indicators. Analyzing a data set and extracting key performance indicators will be practiced. Prompts will be used to support learning in accessing and displaying data in dashboards. Learning how to display key performance indicators on a dashboard will be included in this assignment. </p>

<p align="justify"> For this project you will use Skills Network Labs and Watson Studio. Skills Network Labs is a sandbox environment for learning and completing labs in courses. Whereas Watson Studio, a component of IBM Cloud Pak for Data, is a suite of tools and a collaborative environment for data scientists, data analysts, AI and machine learning engineers, and domain experts to develop and deploy your projects.</p>
